Problem 1: How java managed to be platform-independent explain.

Answer: Java is platform-independent which means that java compiled code by java compiler. 
        It generates .class file which is also known as byte code this byte code can execute also on
        different operating system. In other words
        Java program is written in human understandable language so first java compiler compile the whole
        human understandable code into machine level language to make it understandable by JVM(Java Virtual 
        Machine) then JVM generates byte code that can be executed on different operating system.
        For running byte code only JRE software need to be installed.
        
        Therefore, Java is platform-independent by this quality java is one of the powerful language of the
        World.
